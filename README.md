//A little planning here

Data Structure:

let userInput = [
    {
        valOne: ###,
        valTwo: ###,
        operator: '+','-','*','/', [...I feel like would not want the operator thing in here but let's go with it for now]
        result: ###
    }
]

Hint: should only need a postCalculation and a getCalculation route

1.) Grab inputs and type of operation upong submit
2.) send that data to an array in the server
3.) have the server do the appropriate calculations
3.) send the calculation result back to the client (along with the history data in a x + y = z format)
4.) render the history and result to the DOM
